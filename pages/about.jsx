       <p>Zach Brose is a multi-instrumentalist, producer and songwriter from Minneapolis, MN and based in Los Angeles, CA. &nbsp; His music varies widely from indie-rock centered songwriting to experimental electronica to long-form ambient environments. &nbsp;Not one to settle on any formula, Zach&apos;s curiosity for new methods, sounds and forms is reflected in his wide ranging discography and projects.</p>

       <p>Zachs most recent release, <i>Smear</i>, covers expansive sonic ground from stomping sampled drums of &apos;Daylight&apos; to the hypnotic groove of &apos;Seq iiii&apos; into the swaying bossa of &apos;Susanne&apos;. &nbsp;<i>Smear</i> reflects his reluctance to relinquish to any one type of tune and instead create with doors wide open. </p>

       <p>Zach also writes and records in various projects including Kansas Plates and ar.birn. &nbsp;He has produced records for Jessica Manning, Mik Cool and Marathoner, and continues to exercise his instrumental diversity in sessions and remote recording work.</p>
